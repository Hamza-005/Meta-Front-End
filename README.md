### Responsive Design

<ul>

<li>
Felxible Grids<br>
make measurments in percentages not in pixels
</li>

<li>Fluid Images <br>
place the images in those grids/collumns with max-width set to 100%
</li>

<li>Media Queries<br>
Using JS developers can get the display size, orientation & Aspect Ratio<br>

<br>Example:<br>
@media only screen and(max-width:700px){<br>
    body{<br>
        background-color:blue;<br>
    }<br>
}<br>

</li>

</ul>

<p>Bootstrap has a 12 grid system each row can have a maximum of 12 collumns <br>
Usually, bootstrap automatically allocates the number of collumns needed.<br>
We can specify the number the number of collumns a collumn takes:<br>
lets suppose we want a div to take 4 coloumns col-4 <br>
